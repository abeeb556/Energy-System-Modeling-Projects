# Energy-System-Modeling-Projects
This repository contains:
1) Python models for hydrogen-integrated composite renewable energy systems optimization.

Overview

The Component Oriented Modeling and Optimization open-source package (COMANDO) and Gurobi were utilized to model the various components and solve the mathematically formulated problems respectively.

2) The modeling framework and simulation results for a study evaluating the potential for transporting green hydrogen from West Africa countries to Europe via existing and proposed natural gas pipeline corridors.

Overview

The project investigates hydrogen transport along three major pipeline systems:

⦁	Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline (NMGP)
⦁	Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline (TSGP)
⦁	Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline (MEGP)

These corridors align with Corridor B of the European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB)

Key Components

⦁	Geospatial Processing: Extraction, cleaning, segmentation, and analysis of pipeline shapefiles using geopandas, shapely, NetworkX, amongst others.
⦁	Pipeline Network Modeling: Construction of a hydrogen transport network via optimization (Pipeline length minimization) for flow analysis 
⦁	Scenario Simulation and Analysis: Simulation with GasNetSim and evaluation of hydrogen export potentials from West Africa and transport routes to Europe
